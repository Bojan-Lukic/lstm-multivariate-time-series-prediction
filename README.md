<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project gives an overview on how to develop a dense and deep neural network for making a time series prediction. Python’s development environment Jupyter, extended with the TensorFlow package and deep-learning application Keras is used. The main part shows an applied example of time series prediction with weather data. For this work, a deep recurrent neural network with Long Short-Term Memory cells is used to conduct the time series prediction. The results and evaluation of the work show that a weather prediction with deep neural networks can be successful for a short time period.

<br />
